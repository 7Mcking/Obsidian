Usually large satellites are designed, developed and tested in a timeline of 5 years

# Space Craft Layout Studies
==Electrical architecture plan is based on MIL-STD-1553B plan.==

## Spacecraft Harness modelling
- 2D formboard for harness routing
- Precise wire cut lengths
- Reports
	- BOM
	- Voltage Drop Analysis
	- Segment wise harness mass
==Margin of 300mm is provided on each harness. ==

## Process of Harness Realization
- EDS Database generation
- Harness jig
- Worksheets for each connector
- Connector fabrication and continuity checks
- Routing bundle segregation, trimming
- Other ind fabrication
