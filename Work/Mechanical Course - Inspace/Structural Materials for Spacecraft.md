> Aluminium, magnesium and alloys, Titanium

Fabrication problems
- Storange and handling
- Contamination
- Corrosion
- High humidity

Space Environment
- High Vacuum
- Atomic Oxygen
- Vibrations
- Radiation

Thermal loads
- Direct Sun Load
- Albedo
- IR energy emitted from Planet
- Internal Heat dissipation

## Thermal Control Techniques - Passive and Electrical

Heat Stored = Heat in - heat out + heat dissipated
### Passive Cooling
- Coatings with known optical properties
- Rejecting the internally generated heat through OSR
- Isolation from the harsh environment with MLI

$\alpha_{s}$ -  Solar absorptivity
$E_{IR}$ - Infrared emissivity

Materials are classified in to four categories
- Solar Absorber - 
- Flat absorber
- Flat Reflector
- Solar Reflectors

## Surface Engineering
Design of surface and substrate together as a functionally graded system to give a cost effective performance enhancement of which neither is capable on its own

### Technologies
#### Aluminium
1. Evaporation: Material to be coated on substrate is placed in a vaccum where it is heated to its boiling temperature after which material vapor will be deposited on the surface
2. RF Sputtering 
3. Chemical Vapour Deposition
4. Anodisation: Formation of oxide coating on the substrate. Bath in 15% w/v sulphuric acid and current is passed through this.
5. Hard Anodisation - similar to basic anodisation. Specifically used when there are moving parts for example pulley and rope.
6. Gold Plating: gives corrosion resistance
7. Silver Plating- Highly conductive coating; for RF reducing insertion losses
8. Micro Arc Oxidation of Aluminium Alloys
9. High Velocity Oxy-Fuel Spraying

#### Magnesium
1. Micro Arc Oxidation of Process
2. 

## Thermal Control Elements
Optical Solar Reflectors
MLI Blankets- It is basically thin aluminium with Kepton tape on top
Diffuser Plates - To diffuse heat on larger surfaces
Thermal Interface Materials- 

#### New Generation Materials
- Louvers
- Thermo chromic, photo chromic, electro chromic - Emissivity can be modulated to extreme ranges. Thermo chromic modulates emissivity based on temperature seen
- PGS has high thermal conductivity - 40 micron sheets are available
- AEROGELS 
	- silica aerogels
