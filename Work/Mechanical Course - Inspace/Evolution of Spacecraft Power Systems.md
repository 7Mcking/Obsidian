# Power Sources

==Developed Technologies==
- Primary Batteries
	- Used in short life missions
	- Lithium/Monoflouride
	- Lithium/Thionyl Chloride
	- Silver/Zinc
- Solar Panels
- Radioisotope thermoelectric Generators (RTGs)
	- Used in voyagers, Cassini, Mars Curiosity Rover
	- Long life but very low efficiency (5-6%)
- Fuel Cells
	- Combine 2 chemical components at a controlled rate to produce heat, electricity and some chemical by product
	- In case of hydrogen oxygen fuel cells, power is stored in the form oxygen and hydrogen

==Research Technologies==
1. Stirling Radioisotope generators
2. Chemical/Solar dynamic generators
3. Nuclear Generators

## Energy Storage

==Function Requirements== 
1. continuous and uninterrupted
2. Satisfies peak power demands

==Options==
- Rechargeable Batteries
- Flywheels
- Regenerative Fuels Cells

### Batteries for Energy Storage
==Performance Parameters==
Voltage, energy density, volumetric energy density, power density, operating temperature, operating life, cost

C - Capacity
Charge/Discharge Rate- C/10
DoD - Depth of Discharge
K-Factor - Recharge ratio - Ratio of charge input/charge removed
Trickle Charge- Charge at low rate - compensate for self discharge

#### Major Types
1. Lead acid
2. Nickel Cadmium - long space heritage, relatively simple charge control systems, battery reconditioning necessary 
	- Capacity 7Ah to 40 Ah
	- DoD 60%
	- Energy density 35-40 Whr/kg
	- Life -7-10
	- Drawback - Energy density is low
3. Nickel Hydrogen- Less weight for small power but requires more volume, Used in big satellites, Higher Energy density as compared to nickel cadmium
	- Low Volumetric energy denyure
	- High Self discharge
4. Lithium Ion

## Energy Generation
### Solar Cells
#### Materials
- Silicon -17%
- GaAs - 20%
- GaAs/Ge - 19%
- Polycrystalline devices
- Amorphous devices
- Perovskite-Silicon Tandem solar cells - 34%

#### Multi Junction Solar Cells
 Made of GaInP, GAAs, Ge
 When sunlight falls significant portion of spectrum is absorbed
 Multi junction solar cells are of 27$cm^2$ -> Improves package efficiency


 #### Types of Solar Arrays
 - Flexible solar arrays
 - Rigid Arrays


## Power Distribution and Control

==Power Bus== single place where power is collected and distributed to the load

==Types of Buses==
- Unregulated Bus
	- Solar array output is directly connected to battery and this junction forms the bus
- Sunlit Regulated Bus
- Fully regulated bus
	- Bus voltage is regulated in both sunlit and eclipse periods
	- Involves use of battery discharge and charge regylators
- MPPT - Maximum power point tracker based bus
	- Best suited for cube sat designs

==End of Charge detection==
- By voltage
- By time
- By pressure readings
- By rise in temperature
